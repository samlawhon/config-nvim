# My neovim configuration

Has incremental things that are neovim specific. This is in addition to my
[.vim](https://github.com/renzmann/.vim), with things like LSP support and expanded
wildmenu usage.

## Installation

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:renzmann/config-nvim ~/.config/nvim
```
