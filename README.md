# My neovim configuration

Has incremental things that are neovim specific. This is in addition to my
[.vim](https://github.com/renzmann/.vim), with things like LSP support and expanded
wildmenu usage.

## Installation

This requires my base vim configuration to work properly, so clone both:

```
git clone git@github.com:renzmann/.vim ~/.vim
git clone git@github.com:renzmann/config-nvim ~/.config/nvim
```
